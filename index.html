        <h1 class="post-title">Web Design</h1>
    <div class="post-content">
      <p><span style="color:#1abc9c"><strong>Great web design</strong></span> is so much more than just delivering content and making it look good. When visitors come to your site, they produce a set of feelings about your website and your organization. The type of feelings they produce – positive or negative – are entirely in your hands and should not be overlooked when designing content.</p><br>
      <h3><strong>I focus on four main areas:</strong><br></h3>

      <div class="content"><p><span style="color:#1abc9c"><strong>Content:  </strong></span>With today’s Web design, content should be edited and organized and presented in a tone, so that there is a happy medium between providing adequate and needed information while not overwhelming visitors. When content is in that happy place, visitors are able to find the information quickly and they feel good afterwards.</p><br></div>

      <div class="strong"><p><span style="color:#1abc9c"><strong>Space:  </strong></span>The way a Web page is organized can dramatically affect how a visitor feels while they are there. Organizing content should be a priority in any web design, but this organization should take into consideration the space it takes up on the site.  White space plays an important role in any type of design work, especially Web design, because it visually gives a resting place for the visitor. These resting places are often found in margins and the space around things.  Keeping things simple with a well-organized website using adequate white space tells visitors you know what’s important and you don’t want to waste their time.</p> <br></div>

      <div class="color"><p><span style="color:#1abc9c"><strong>Color:  </strong></span> Most visual identities have neutral colors (i.e the tints, shades, and hues of whites, grays, and blacks) that are used along with their main colors. In most modern web designs, these neutral colors often take dominance in terms of how much real estate they take up.  When designing a website, often the colors are dictated by the organization’s new or existing visual identity (or brand). But how these colors are used affects how the visitor feels when they visit your site.  Neutrals act much like white space does: it provides an opportunity for rest.</p> <br></div>

      <div class="type"><p><span style="color:#1abc9c"><strong>Typogrophy:  </strong></span> Typography can convey emotions and feelings for visitors to your website.  The way type is presented on the page is also important. Leading (space between the lines) and kerning (space between the letters) should be evaluated as well. Large leading with lots of white space between lines makes the copy feel airier and easier to read; little leading gives a crowded feeling and is hard to read more than one paragraph at a time.  Space between paragraphs, margins between blocks of text and other elements on the page, and font size (and its relation to leading) are also factors to consider.</p> <br></div>


      <p>The way people view you and the way you present yourself is the impression you will leave behind. As you go about the business of carrying out your life people will make judgments about your appearance, personality and capabilities.  If you want to learn more about me, check about the

      <h2 class="post-title">The Cost of 10,0000 Hours</h2>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>They say it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill.  However, when you have a family, children, dogs, what is the cost you are paying for the hours you put into the skill.  These questions plague me as I look into the face above, so eager to play while I try to master another language, technique or practice one that I am trying to learn.</p>

      <div class="post-content">
        <p>If someone would have told me a week ago that I would be on the road to becomming a better web designer, I don't know that I would have believed them.  However, now I have really taken my skills to the next level.</p>
        <p>I have come across an app that I am really enjoying called Mimo and supplimenting the learning with my other books and classes that I've started.  Additionally, it's provided a much needed refresser course and given me confidence than I know more than I think I do.</p>
