Hi all,
This repository is just a website created to practice coding.  I am a web designer who works in WordPress and thought I needed to learn more about all things coding.  It's one thing to take a class on HTML, CSS and Javascript, but it really doesn't sink in until you start using it.
I started out with the main.css page.  I then added w3.css to see if I could play with some of the fun things on the W3Schools pages.  All of the effects, animations, etc.  The only bad thing about that is that it's so crammed with stuff, that its hard to find the code you are dealing with if you want to change something or look at a section.  Also, I downloaded v.4.6 I think.  Maybe that's why I'm having trouble finding the code???  Since some of the effects are from v. 3.  
Taking an animation class, so I will be using this to do some of the animations as well.
